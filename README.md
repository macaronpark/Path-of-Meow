## 2. How to Use

Since `ex-meow` doesn't provide auto-image-scaling, it needs certain images(label on field, mark on map, icon in inventory...) which help detecting Exalted Orbs or something from you.

2. Excute `ex-meow`.
3. Tap 'Detect' button and hunting Exalted Orbs. When you get one, feel a flush of joy with meow sound.
